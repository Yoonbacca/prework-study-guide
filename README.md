# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project was created in order to illustrate the basic concepts needed to design a simpple webpage. 

I built this project in order to practice and record HTML/CSS/JS concepts in the prework literature. 

This will allow me to begin my first project as a developer as well as get familiarized with Git and GitHub. 

Since I was familiar with these concepts already, the majority of the learning I experienced centered around Git and the Git workflow.
