# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created in order to illustrate the basic concepts needed to design a simpple webpage. 

I built this project in order to practice and record HTML/CSS/JS concepts in the prework literature. 

This will allow me to begin my first project as a developer as well as get familiarized with Git and GitHub. 

Since I was familiar with these concepts already, the majority of the learning I experienced centered around Git and the Git workflow.
